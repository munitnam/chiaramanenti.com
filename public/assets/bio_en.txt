Somewhere between blues, metal and film scoring, Chiara invites listeners on a musical journey that transcends genre boundaries.

Fascinated by the guitar, she soon taught herself how to play blues and later found a strong connection with progressive music. At age twelve, she was already performing on stage and opening for renowned artists.

A few years later, she began working as a session guitarist, recording acoustic and electric guitar for a wide range of projects, from songs to orchestral pieces. In 2023, she also embarked on a career as a composer for film and video games, turning the guitar into her own artistic signature. Her compositions are driven by a strong focus on storytelling and the craft of immersive atmospheres.

After the release of her debut single <a href="https://chiaramanenti.bandcamp.com/track/conversation-blues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conversation Blues</a> - a tribute to her roots - she is now working on a debut prog metal concept album, Ascension - a sweeping sonic odyssey where electric guitar soars alongside orchestra, unfolding a story inspired by fantasy and science fiction universes.
